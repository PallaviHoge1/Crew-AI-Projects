It involves summarizing and visualizing data to gain insights into its distribution, patterns, and correlations. The goal of EDA is to identify key features and anomalies in the data.\n\n**Bullet Takeaways:**\n\n• EDA helps data scientists understand the basic summary statistics (mean, median, mode) of a dataset.\n• It involves visualization techniques such as plots and charts to represent data distributions and relationships.\n• Effective EDA can reveal patterns, outliers, and correlations that inform subsequent analysis and modeling.",
